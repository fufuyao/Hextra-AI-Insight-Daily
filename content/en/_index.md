### Product & Feature Updates

1.  Runway just dropped its "General World Model" GWM-1, totally reshaping AI creation with three core modules. This isn't just about content generation; [Runway's GWM-1 (AI News)](https://runwayml.com/research/introducing-runway-gwm-1) *really* understands how the world works! Its GWM-Worlds module crafts **infinitely explorable 3D spaces** with spacetime consistency. GWM-Avatars create audio-driven virtual characters, while GWM-Robotics provides synthetic training environments for robots. On top of that, the accompanying Gen-4.5 now features native audio generation and multi-shot consistent editing, enabling some seriously cool joint audio-video modeling. ✨<br/>![AI News: Runway GWM-1 Architecture Diagram](https://source.hubtoday.app/images/2025/12/news_01kcc4wnmyempbpgcgnct3qjww.avif)<br/>

2.  Google Translate just got a major upgrade, now powered by the Gemini model, and it's a total game-changer for real-time voice translation. [Google's upgraded translation service (AI News)](https://www.xiaohu.ai/c/xiaohu-ai/google-5af468) leverages Gemini to understand context and tone, making translations sound way more natural. Text translation handles 20 languages, and its voice-to-voice translation is in Beta, supporting over 70 languages—your headphones can literally become an instant interpreter! 🤯 The speaking practice feature has also expanded to 20 countries, offering real-time corrections and progress tracking. Talk about a glow-up! ✨<br/>

3.  Grok just got a deep integration with Tesla, making voice-activated route planning a total reality. Grok's voice commands can now recognize your intent and set routes for Teslas, even adjusting travel plans in real-time. Netizens are already sharing [demo videos (AI News)](https://x.com/imxiaohu/status/1999828212218781838) of this in action. If this integrates with FSD, imagine verbally commanding your car to complete complex tasks! That's next-level! 🚗<br/><video src="https://source.hubtoday.app/images/2025/12/news_01kcc4yajqekjtrwkapq6pkvqn.mp4"></video><br/>

4.  Google Gemini Pro membership now lets you share its benefits with up to five people. Gemini Pro members can hook up to 5 others with their perks, and even gift friends a 4-month trial! Talk about a sweet deal, making the subscription model way more flexible. 🤝<br/>

### Frontier Research

1.  GPT-5.2 dropped and got slammed with bad reviews within 24 hours, highlighting a huge gap between benchmark tests and real-world usability. OpenAI's [GPT-5.2 (AI News)](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzA3MzI4MjgzMw==&mid=2651007119&idx=1&sn=8808a5b8f75b6c33b1fd9a8e5c0815fd) even scored lower than Claude Sonnet 3.7 on SimpleBench, making a basic "garlic" letter 'r' count error – seriously?! 🤦 Its emotional intelligence seems to have taken a nosedive, giving mechanical responses to scenarios involving disfavored children. The safety refusal mechanism is overly strict, earning it criticism for being "inhumane." Netizens are roasting it, saying high benchmark scores don't mean squat in real conversation scenarios. 📉<br/>![AI News: GPT-5.2 Benchmark Comparison Bar Chart](https://source.hubtoday.app/images/2025/12/news_01kcc4zd41ewvb87bmpwbrzszf.avif)<br/>

2.  Gemini TTS now offers precise control over voice parameters through simple prompts. Li Cang's [AI comic drama application (AI News)](https://x.com/op7418/status/1999491858662326281) showcases Gemini 2.5 TTS, letting users tweak gender, intonation, tone, and even the pronunciation of specific words—all with just a prompt! 🗣️ Paired with Nano Banana Pro for scene generation, this combo enables fully interactive storytelling. Pretty wild, right? ✨<br/><video src="https://source.hubtoday.app/images/2025/12/news_01kcc5002hexr8r7vhkqxjvd2g.mp4"></video><br/>

### Industry Outlook & Social Impact

1.  Oracle's massive bet on OpenAI is sparking a huge wave of contract losses and customer migrations. [Oracle went all-in, betting approximately $300 billion on OpenAI (AI News)](https://newshacker.me/story?id=46246031), and now, as long-term enterprise contracts expire, clients are flocking to PostgreSQL and OpenJDK to cut costs. Banks are gradually migrating via Amazon RDS, and some vendors, like Hyland, have even announced they're dropping Oracle support. Talk about a shake-up! 💸 Credit default swaps are climbing, and the market is getting a bit antsy about potential AI investment overheating. 🔥<br/>

2.  AI-driven white-collar layoffs might be way bigger than we expect, and frankly, politicians are ghosting the problem. A hot Reddit thread points out that [AI can now perform knowledge work instead of just assisting (AI News)](https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1plkvps/whitecollar_layoffs_are_coming_at_a_scale_weve/). With Opus 4.5, GPT-5.2, and Gemini 3.0 integrating into business processes, white-collar jobs could shrink by a whopping 30-70% over the next decade. 😬 The political sphere has zero solutions, and just saying "skill upgrades" isn't going to fix this mess. It's a wake-up call! 🚨<br/>

3.  AI subscription dependency could lead to a "pharmaceutical" profit model, locking users in for life. Some folks believe LLM companies are getting teenagers hooked on AI to do their homework, only to jack up prices when they're adults and can't read or write without it—potentially charging 10% of their salary as a usage fee! 🤑 This dark business path, alongside automated layoffs, is one of the two major profit directions, yet it's rarely discussed in the [media (AI News)](https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1pl9x64/the_unspoken_future_plan_for_ai/). Spooky! 👻<br/>

4.  Netizens are calling for people to maintain a "human feel" and be wary of AI content becoming too generic. Tw93 posted that Chinese tweets are crammed with clickbait phrases like "brothers, it's blowing up!," and AI-generated content often lacks any real uniqueness. The post emphasizes keeping [personality traits and taste (AI News)](https://x.com/HiTw93/status/1999464403192979680) intact in the age of AI, urging everyone to avoid becoming mere appendages to the tech. Keep it real, folks! 🤖➡️🧑‍💻<br/>
