# Terms of Service

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

Hey there! 👋 Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (aka "the Site" or "we"). Before you dive into using our services, please give these Terms of Service a good read. By visiting or using our Site, you're totally agreeing to everything here.

## 1. About Our Services
Our services are all about bringing you premium, paid subscription content and member perks! 🌟 This includes awesome stuff like blog posts, exclusive resources, ebooks, and cool community interactions. Just a heads-up, some content is only for our subscribers!

## 2. User Accounts & Registration
*   To get started, users need to sign up for an account with a valid email and a password.
*   Account holders, you're responsible for keeping your account secure and for all activities under it. Seriously, **no transferring or sharing your account**!
*   If anyone breaks these terms, we've got the right to **suspend or terminate** their account. Just sayin'.

## 3. Paid Subscription Services
*   Our paid subscription services are billed monthly or annually, with all costs clearly shown on the checkout page.
*   Payments? We use trusted third-party platforms like Stripe and PayPal, so don't sweat it – we never store your payment info.
*   Heads up! Your subscription will **auto-renew** unless you cancel before your current billing cycle ends.
*   Good news for first-timers! We have a **14-day refund policy**. If you're not stoked with our service within 14 days of your first purchase, you can totally ask for a full refund. Just hit us up at the contact email below and tell us what's up. Each user gets one shot at this. If it's past 14 days or not your first rodeo, we generally say **no refunds** unless the law explicitly forces our hand. 🙅‍♀️

## 4. Content Usage & Intellectual Property
*   Alright, let's talk about our content. All original content **belongs to hubtoday** – that means no copying, reprinting, or using it for commercial purposes without our permission.
*   Users, you're getting a **non-exclusive, non-transferable right to access** our stuff, strictly for your personal learning and reading pleasure. 📚
*   Got commercial plans or need to quote us a lot? Shoot us a message to get authorization first!

## 5. User Conduct Rules
*   When you're hanging out with us, please remember: **don't** upload, post, or share anything illegal, harassing, false, offensive, or infringing on anyone else's rights. That's a big no-no!
*   Also, **don't even think about** using tech tricks to mass download, scrape, or crack our member-exclusive content. Seriously, that's not cool. 🚫
*   We reserve the right to yank any inappropriate content and **ban rule-breaking users**. Fair warning!

## 6. Service Changes & Interruptions
*   Heads up! We can change, suspend, or stop any part or all of our services at any time, without giving you a prior heads-up.
*   If something out of our control happens – like a force majeure, server issues, or third-party service outages – making content temporarily unavailable, we're **not on the hook for any compensation**. Just so you know!

## 7. Disclaimer
*   Quick disclaimer: The info we provide here is just for kicks and general reference. It **doesn't count** as any kind of professional advice (like financial, legal, or medical stuff, for example). 🧠
*   And for any direct or indirect losses you might run into from using our content or services, we're **totally not liable**. Just keeping it real!

## 8. Governing Law
*   These Service Terms are governed by, and interpreted according to, the laws of the State of California, USA, without regard to its conflict of law principles.
*   Got a beef regarding these terms? First off, let's try to hash it out amicably. If that doesn't work, you're agreeing to take any disputes to the courts with jurisdiction in Santa Clara County, California. ⚖️
