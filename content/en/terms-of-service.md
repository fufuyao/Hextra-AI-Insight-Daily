# Terms of Service

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

Hey there! Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (aka “**This Site**” or “**we**”). Before you dive into all the cool stuff, please give these Terms of Service a good read. By using or even just checking out our site, you’re basically saying, “Yep, I’m in!” and agreeing to these terms. 😎

## 1. About Our Services
So, what do **Our Services** (aka This Site) offer? We hook users up with paid subscription content and awesome member services. Think blog posts, exclusive resources, e-books, and even cool community interaction. Just a heads-up: some of this good stuff is exclusively for our subscribers! 🚀

## 2. User Accounts & Registration
- For **User Accounts**, you'll need to sign up with a valid email and create a password. Easy peasy!
- Listen up: You're totally responsible for keeping your account secure and for anything that happens under your login. Seriously, **no transferring or sharing your account**, okay?
- If you break any of these terms, **This Site** has the right to **pause or even close down** your account. Just a heads up! 🛑

## 3. Paid Subscription Services
- **Paid Subscription Services** are billed either monthly or annually, and you'll always see the exact cost on the checkout page. No surprises!
- All your payments are handled securely by awesome third-party platforms like Stripe and PayPal. We never store your payment deets on our end. Phew! 🔒
- Your subscription will **automatically renew** – super convenient! But if you need a break, just make sure to cancel before your current billing cycle wraps up.
- **14-Day Refund Policy**: Here's the deal: If you're a first-timer signing up for our services and you're not totally thrilled within 14 days of your purchase, you can snag a full refund. Just shoot us an email (you'll find it at the end of these terms!) and tell us why you're bouncing. Heads up: This is a one-time gig per user. After that 14-day window, or if you're not a first-time subscriber, all payments are typically **non-refundable**, unless the law says otherwise. So, choose wisely! 🤔

## 4. Content Use & Intellectual Property
- When it comes to **Content Use & Intellectual Property**, here’s the scoop: All the original content you find here is **copyrighted by This Site (hubtoday)**. That means no copying, reposting, or using it for commercial stuff without our permission. Capiche?
- You, as a user, get a cool but **non-exclusive, non-transferable right to access** it for your personal learning and reading pleasure.
- If you're thinking big – like commercial use or quoting a ton of our content – please, pretty please, reach out to us for authorization. We're friendly! 😊

## 5. User Conduct Guidelines
- Let's talk **User Conduct Guidelines**. Basically, play nice! You're **prohibited** from uploading, posting, or spreading any content that’s illegal, harassing, false, offensive, or that messes with anyone else’s rights. Seriously, don't do it. 🙅‍♀️
- Also, it's a big fat **NO** to using technical tricks to bulk download, scrape, or crack our member-exclusive content. That's just not cool.
- If you break these rules, **This Site** has every right to yank down the offending content and even **ban users who don't play by the rules**. Consider this your friendly warning! 😉

## 6. Service Changes & Interruptions
- About **Service Changes & Interruptions**: Just so you know, we totally reserve the right to tweak, pause, or even stop parts or all of our services at any time, and we might not always give a heads-up. It's just how the tech world rolls sometimes! 🤷‍♀️
- Also, if something totally out of our control happens – like an act of nature, server oopsies, or a third-party service going down – and you can't access content temporarily, **This Site** isn't on the hook for any compensation. Bummer, but true!

## 7. Disclaimer
- Quick **Disclaimer** from us: The info you find on **This Site** is purely for reference. It's definitely **not** meant to be professional advice – seriously, for stuff like financial, legal, or medical advice, hit up a pro! 🧑‍⚕️⚖️💰
- And here's the kicker: **This Site** is absolutely **not responsible** for any losses, big or small, that you might suffer from using our content or services. Just keeping it real!

## 8. Governing Law
- Let's talk **Governing Law**: These Terms of Service are governed by and interpreted according to the laws of the State of California, USA 🇺🇸, completely disregarding any conflict of law principles.
- If any tiffs or disagreements pop up related to these terms, we'll first try to sort things out super friendly-like through negotiation. But if we can't hug it out, you agree that any disputes will be handled by the courts with jurisdiction in Santa Clara County, California. So, you know, California dreaming for legal stuff!
