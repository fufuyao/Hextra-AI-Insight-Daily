# Terms of Service

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

Hey there! 👋 Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (referred to as "the Site" or "we"). Before you dive into using our services, please take a moment to carefully read these Terms of Service. By accessing or using the Site, you're essentially saying you agree to and accept these terms.

## 1. About Our Services
**The Site** offers paid subscription content and member services. These goodies include, but aren't limited to, blog posts, exclusive resources, e-books, and community interactions. Just a heads-up, some content is only accessible to our awesome subscribers!

## 2. User Registration & Accounts
- **Users** need to provide a valid email address and set a password to register for an account.
- **Users** are totally responsible for their account's security and all activities under it. Seriously, **don't** transfer or share your account with anyone else!
- **The Site** has the right to **suspend or terminate** a user's account if they violate these terms. No funny business!

## 3. Paid Subscription Services
- **Our subscription services** are billed on a monthly or annual basis, and you'll see the exact fees clearly displayed on the checkout page.
- **All payments** are processed securely through third-party payment platforms (like Stripe, PayPal). Rest assured, **the Site** never stores your payment information. Phew!
- **Subscriptions** will **automatically renew** unless you cancel before your current billing cycle ends. Don't forget if you want to stop!
- **Our 14-day refund policy** is pretty sweet: First-time subscribers, if you're not totally thrilled with our service within 14 days of purchase, you can snag a full refund. Just hit us up via the contact email at the end of these terms and tell us why you're unhappy. Each user gets one shot at this refund. After 14 days, or for non-first-time subscriptions, **no refunds** will be issued unless legally required.

## 4. Content Use & Intellectual Property
- **All original content** is **copyrighted to hubtoday**. Please, pretty please, don't copy, reproduce, or use it for commercial purposes without our authorization.
- **Users** are granted a **non-exclusive, non-transferable access right** for personal learning and reading only. Keep it for yourself!
- For commercial use or extensive quoting, please reach out to **the Site** to get permission. We're usually friendly!

## 5. User Conduct Guidelines
- **Users** are strictly **prohibited** from uploading, posting, or distributing any content that's illegal, harassing, false, offensive, or infringes on others' rights. Play nice!
- **Users** are also **forbidden** from using technical means to bulk download, crawl, or crack member content. That's a big no-no! 🙅‍♀️
- **The Site** has the right to remove inappropriate content and **ban violating users**. You've been warned!

## 6. Service Changes & Interruption
- **We (the Site)** reserve the right to change, suspend, or terminate all or part of our services at any time, without prior notice. Things change, ya know?
- If **the Site** becomes temporarily inaccessible due to unforeseen circumstances like force majeure, server failures, or third-party service interruptions, **the Site** **will not be liable for compensation**. It's out of our hands sometimes!

## 7. Disclaimer
- **The information provided by the Site** is purely for reference and **does not constitute** any professional advice (like financial, legal, or medical stuff). Don't take our word as gospel for crucial decisions!
- **The Site** **is not responsible** for any direct or indirect losses users might incur from using our content or services. Use at your own risk, folks!

## 8. Governing Law
- **These Terms of Service** are governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of California, USA, without regard to its conflict of law principles.
- **Any disputes** arising out of or related to these terms should first be settled through friendly negotiation between the parties. If that doesn't work out, you agree to submit to the jurisdiction of the courts located in Santa Clara County, California. Let's keep it civil, but we know where to go if it hits the fan!
