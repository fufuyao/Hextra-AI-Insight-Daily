# Privacy Policy

*Last updated: June 1, 2025*

---

This Privacy Policy is all about how we handle your info – collecting it, using it, and spilling the beans (when we have to!) when you're using our Service. It also tells you about your privacy rights and how the big bad law has your back.

We totally use your Personal Data to keep the Service running smoothly and make it even better. By jumping in and using the Service, you're essentially saying 'Yep, I'm cool with you collecting and using my info as laid out in this Privacy Policy!'

## Explanations and Definitions

### Interpretation
Okay, so the capitalized words you'll see here? They've got specific meanings, which we're about to lay out. And just a heads-up, these definitions stick whether the word is singular or plural – no tricky business!

### Definitions
For the lowdown on this Privacy Policy, here's what we mean by...

- **Account** is basically your personal login that lets you dive into our Service or specific parts of it. Think of it as your unique pass! 🔑

- **Affiliate** means a company that either controls, is controlled by, or is chilling under the same control as us. "Control" here means owning 50% or more of the voting shares or equity – basically, they've got a significant say! 🤝

- **Company** (or "We," "Us," or "Our" in this whole agreement) is simply **hubtoday** – that's us! 😎

- **Cookies** are just tiny files a website tucks onto your computer, phone, or whatever device you're using. They hold bits of info, like your browsing history on that site, for all sorts of reasons. 🍪

- **Country**? That's California, USA! 🇺🇸

- **Device** is pretty much anything you use to get to our Service – think computers, phones, tablets, you name it! 💻📱

- **Personal Data** is any info that can point back to a specific person – like, identifiable info. 🕵️‍♀️

- **Service** is basically this website you're on right now. 🌐

- **Service Provider** is any cool individual or company that crunches data for us. They're the third-party folks we hire to help run the Service, deliver it to you, handle related stuff, or just help us figure out how people are using it. They're our behind-the-scenes helpers! 💪

- **Usage Data** is the info we automatically gather, either from you just using the Service or from the Service's tech backbone itself (like how long you chill on a page). 📈

- **Website**? That's **hubtoday**, which you can find right here: `https://ai.hubtoday.app/`! 🚀

- **You** means you, the awesome individual using or checking out our Service! Or, if you're representing a company or other legal crew, it means them! You got it? 😉

## Collecting and Using Your Personal Data

### Types of Data Collected

#### Personal Data
When you're hanging out on our Service, we might ask for some **Personal Data** – stuff that helps us get in touch or figure out who you are. This personal info could be, but isn't limited to: 👇

- Email address
- Usage Data

#### Usage Data
**Usage Data**? Yeah, that's collected automatically the moment you start using our Service. No fuss!

This **Usage Data** can cover your Device's Internet Protocol address (like its internet fingerprint), what browser you're using (and its version), which pages you're checking out on our Service, when you visited and for how long, unique device IDs, and other techy diagnostic info. It's all about how you interact! 💻

When you're hitting up the Service on your phone or tablet (a **mobile device**), we might automatically snag some information, including, but not limited to, the type of mobile device you're rocking, its unique ID, its IP address, your mobile OS, the kind of mobile browser you use, and more unique device IDs and diagnostic goodies. It's all about optimizing your mobile experience! 📱

And hey, whether you're on a desktop or going mobile, we might also grab whatever info your browser decides to send our way! 📡

### Tracking Technologies and Cookies
Alright, let's talk about **Cookies and similar tracking technologies**! 🍪 We use them to keep tabs on what's happening on our Service and stash away some info. We're talking about cool tech like beacons, tags, and scripts – they help us gather and track data, ultimately making our Service better and giving us insights. Here's a peek at what we use: 👇

- **Cookies or Browser Cookies** (same thing, really!): Remember those tiny files? Well, a Cookie is just that – a small file that lands on your Device. You're the boss: you can tell your browser to reject all Cookies or give you a heads-up when one's trying to sneak in. But here's the catch: if you're not cool with Cookies, some parts of our Service might not work for you. So, unless you've tweaked your browser settings to give Cookies the boot, our Service will likely be using them. Just sayin'! 😉
- **Web Beacons** (or "clear gifs," "pixel tags," "single-pixel gifs" – fancy names for tiny stuff!): Some bits of our Service and our emails might have these tiny electronic files. They're super handy for us to count folks who've visited certain pages or opened an email. Plus, they help us with other website stats, like seeing how popular a section is or just making sure our systems and servers are all good to go. Pretty neat, huh? ✨

**Cookies** come in two flavors: 'Persistent' or 'Session' Cookies. Think of Persistent Cookies as the ones that stick around on your computer or phone even after you've logged off. Session Cookies, on the other hand, are like fleeting guests – they disappear the second you close your browser. Poof! 💨

Why do we bother with both **Session and Persistent Cookies**? Well, we use 'em for the reasons we're about to spill: 👇

- **Necessary / Essential Cookies** (yep, they're crucial!):
  - **Type**: Session Cookies
  - **Who's in charge**: That's us! 🙋‍♀️
  - **Why we use 'em**: These are the *must-have* Cookies that let us actually give you the services on our Website and unlock its cool features. They're like the bouncers for your account, making sure it's really you and stopping any funny business. Without these bad boys, the stuff you're trying to do just wouldn't work, simple as that! We only deploy them to make sure you get the services you asked for.

- **Cookies Policy / Notice Acceptance Cookies** (the "you cool with cookies?" kind):
  - **Type**: Persistent Cookies
  - **Who's in charge**: Still us!
  - **Why we use 'em**: These are just for remembering if you've already given us the thumbs-up to use Cookies on the Website. One less pop-up for you! 👍

- **Functionality Cookies** (making life easier!):
  - **Type**: Persistent Cookies
  - **Who's in charge**: Yep, still us!
  - **Why we use 'em**: These Cookies are super helpful because they remember your choices when you're cruising around the Website – like keeping your login info handy or remembering your preferred language. The whole point? To give you a more personalized experience and save you the headache of typing in your preferences every single time. Convenience for the win! ✨

### How We Use Your Personal Data
So, why do we use **Personal Data**? The Company might use your info for these reasons: 👇

- **To provide and maintain our Service**: This includes keeping tabs on how our Service is being used to make sure it's always running tip-top. 🛠️
- **To manage Your Account**: We use it to handle your registration as a Service user. The Personal Data you hand over lets you get into all the cool features available only to registered users. Easy peasy! ✅
- **For contract performance**: Basically, we use it to set up, stick to, and fulfill the purchase contracts for anything you buy from us, or any other agreement you make with us through the Service. Gotta keep our promises! 🤝
- **To contact You**: We might reach out via email, phone calls, texts, or other electronic cool ways (like push notifications from our mobile app!) to give you updates or important info about features, products, or services you've signed up for. This includes security updates – only when it's totally necessary or makes sense, of course! 📞💬
- **To provide You with news**, sweet deals, and general intel about other cool stuff, services, and events we've got brewing. This is usually similar to what you've already checked out or bought – unless you've told us to chill out and not send you this kind of info. Your call! 📣
- **To manage Your requests**: Yep, we use your info to handle and take care of any requests you toss our way. We're here to help! 📝
- **For business transfers**: If we ever get involved in a merger, sale, restructuring, or any kind of asset transfer (think big business moves!), we might use your info to scope out or make that happen. This includes situations like bankruptcy, where the Personal Data we hold about our Service users could be part of the assets being transferred. Just keeping it real! 💼
- **For other purposes**: We might also use your info for other cool stuff like deep-diving into data analytics, spotting usage trends, figuring out if our promos are actually working, and generally just beefing up our Service, products, marketing, and *your* overall experience! Always striving for better! ✨

Okay, so when might we **share your personal info**? Here's the lowdown: 👇

- **With Service Providers**: We might share your personal info with our Service Providers so they can help us keep an eye on how the Service is used and maybe even get in touch with you. They're part of the team! 🤝
- **For business transfers**: If we're ever in talks for a merger, selling off company assets, getting financing, or another company is buying us out (totally normal business stuff!), we might share or transfer your personal info during those discussions or the actual transfer. It's all part of the deal! 💲
- **With Affiliates**: We might share your info with our Affiliates (remember them? Our parent company, sister companies, joint ventures – basically our extended family!). When we do, we'll make sure they promise to play by the rules of this Privacy Policy. Pinky swear! 😉
- **With business partners**: Sometimes we team up with other businesses. We might share your info with these partners so they can hook you up with specific products, services, or cool promotions. It's all about bringing you more value! ✨
- **With other users**: If you're sharing personal info or just chatting it up in public areas of our Service, just know that everyone can see that info – and it might even get shared outside the Service. So, share wisely! 🗣️
- **With Your consent**: And hey, if you give us the green light, we might just spill your personal info for any other reason you agree to. You're in control! 👍

### Retention of Your Personal Data
So, how long does the **Company hang onto your Personal Data**? Only for as long as we *really* need it for the purposes listed in this Privacy Policy. We'll keep and use your Personal Data as long as it takes to meet our legal duties (like if the law says we gotta keep it), sort out any disagreements, and make sure our legal agreements and policies are followed. Fair enough, right? ⏳

The **Company will also keep Usage Data** for our own internal analysis – you know, to make things smarter behind the scenes. Usually, we don't hold onto Usage Data for too long. But, if it's helping us beef up security, make our Service even better, or if we're legally bound to keep it for longer, then it sticks around a bit more. Safety first, right? 🛡️

### Transfer of Your Personal Data
So, about the **transfer of your Personal Data**... Your info, including all that Personal Data, gets processed at our Company offices and wherever else our partners are doing their thing. This means your data might jet off to and be stored on computers outside your state, province, or country – places where data protection laws might be a little different from yours. It's a global world, after all! 🌍

By giving your 'okay' to this Privacy Policy and sending us your info, you're basically saying, 'Yep, I'm cool with that transfer!' Just so you know! 👍

Don't sweat it though! The **Company will take all reasonable steps** to make sure your data is handled securely and totally aligns with this Privacy Policy. We won't send your Personal Data off to any organization or country unless we're *super sure* there are solid security controls in place for your data and other personal info. Your safety is our jam! 🔒

### Delete Your Personal Data
Good news! **You have the right to delete** – or ask us to help you delete – any Personal Data we've collected about you. It's your info, after all! 👋

Our Service actually might let you zap some of your info directly from within the Service itself. Pretty handy, right? ✨

You can totally **update, change, or delete your info anytime**! Just log into your Account (if you've got one) and hit up the account settings where you can manage your personal deets. Or, if that's not cutting it, just hit us up directly to ask for access, corrections, or deletion of any personal info you've given us. We're here for it! 💬

Heads-up though: we might have to **hold onto some info** if we've got a legal obligation or a valid reason to do so. Just keeping it by the book! 📚

### Disclosure of Your Personal Data

#### Business Transactions
Okay, so what if the **Company gets into a business transaction** like a merger, acquisition, or asset sale? Your Personal Data might get transferred. But don't worry, we'll totally give you a heads-up *before* your data moves and falls under a different Privacy Policy. Transparency is key! 🔔

#### Law enforcement
Sometimes, the **Company might be forced to disclose your Personal Data** if the law demands it, or if public authorities (like a court or government agency) hit us with a valid request. It's not our first choice, but sometimes we gotta play by the rules! 👮‍♀️

#### Other Legal Requirements
The **Company might also disclose your Personal Data** if we genuinely believe it's necessary to: 👇

- Comply with a legal obligation (gotta follow the law!) ⚖️
- Protect and defend the Company's rights or property
- Prevent or investigate possible shady business related to the Service
- Protect the personal safety of our Service users or the general public
- Protect against legal liability (no one wants lawsuits!) 🙅‍♀️

### Security of Your Personal Data
**The security of Your Personal Data** is a huge deal to us, for real! But let's be super clear: no method of sending stuff over the internet or storing it electronically is *ever* 100% bulletproof. While We seriously try our best, using commercially acceptable ways to protect your Personal Data, we just can't give you a rock-solid guarantee of absolute security. It's the internet, after all! 🤷‍♀️

## Children's Privacy
Quick heads-up on **Children's Privacy**! Our Service is *not* for anyone under 13. We absolutely do not knowingly collect personal info from kids under that age. If you're a parent or guardian and realize your little one has given us Personal Data, please, please get in touch with us! And if we ever find out we've accidentally collected data from a child under 13 without a parent's 'okay,' we'll ditch that info from our servers ASAP. We're serious about this! 🙏

If we ever need your 'consent' as the legal basis for processing your info, and your country says a parent has to give that consent, then yep, we might ask for your parent's permission *before* we collect and use that info. Just playing by the rules! 📋

## Links to Other Websites
Heads up on **Links to Other Websites**! Our Service might have links to other sites that we *don't* run. If you click on one of those third-party links, you'll be whisked away to *their* site. We seriously, seriously recommend you peek at the Privacy Policy of every single site you visit. Stay safe out there! 🚨

Just so we're clear: we have zero control over, and take absolutely no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or any practices of those third-party sites or services. You're on your own once you leave our turf! 🤷‍♂️

## Changes to this Privacy Policy
Heads up! We might **update Our Privacy Policy** every now and then. When we do, we'll let you know about any changes by just slapping the new Privacy Policy right here on this page. Easy peasy! 🔄

Before those changes go live, we'll give you a shout-out via email and/or a big, noticeable announcement on our Service. Plus, we'll update that 'Last updated' date right at the top of this Privacy Policy. You'll be in the loop! 📧✨

So, our friendly advice? **Review this Privacy Policy periodically** to catch any changes. Any tweaks to this Privacy Policy are official the moment we post them right here on this page. Knowledge is power! 🧠
